# Pokemon Trainer

The Pokemon Tracker app allows users to search through 800+ unique Pokemon using the PokeAPI. Pokemon can be found via their name, or PokeDex Number. Each Pokemon is displayed with information about their height, weight, type, and a brief description.
Pokemon can also be caught, and added to a specific team of 6.

## Learning Goals
